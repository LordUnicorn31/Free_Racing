# Free Racing
Free Racing is a homemade videogame made by a student of the GDDV of CITM.

This is a racing game in which you are allowed to run freely in a circuit with a set of obstacles. But be careful! You will need to prevent the dark light from getting you.

# Controls

SPACEBAR -> to start the game

W -> move forward

S -> move backwards

A -> move to the left

D -> move to the right

X -> Brake

R -> Restart
